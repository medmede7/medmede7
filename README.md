<!---
First of all I would apologize for 2 things :
First is my English level. But I would prefer comment my code with a low English level than in french.
Second is my programming use. I am not a programmer, I learned multiple languages but never learn how to code rules.
I would prefer start my project presentation with these two apologies to allow you to be indulgent with the code you will see here. But, I am here to learn so all remarques on my code form or my English is welcome.
