- 👋 Hi, I’m @medmede7
- 👀 I’m interested in smartbuildings and smarthomes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, SQL and all langages which may allow me to create a boxe for home automation
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me mederic.boistard@gmail.com
- With my low level programming background for embedded electronic, I was used to use langage as C, assembler and VHDL.
Now, I'm looking to open my mind to data science and big data mining oriented langages as Python (already learned a little)


<!---
First of all I would apologize for 2 things :
First is my English level. But I would prefer comment my code with a low English level than in french.
Second is my programming use. I am not a programmer, I learned multiple languages but never learn how to code rules.
I would prefer start my project presentation with these two apologies to allow you to be indulgent with the code you will see here. But, I am here to lear so all remarques on my code form or my English is welcome.

Here is my project.

I have a raspberry pi 3b in my possession and 2 hard drives. The aim of this project is, through the RPI to :
1. Be able to access one of the two hard drives from every devices (Windows and Android devices) in the house (mines for a first step)
2. Create a database of all my folders and files contained on the drive. It's been a long time a bought my drive and year after year I store a large amount of data sometime in a good order and sometimes not... Database will help me to explore all folders and files in my hard drive.
3. Create a automatic savegard of my first hard drive on the second. Regularly the first will be copy on the second, format and data from the second will be restored on the first. Data have to stay on the second drive.
4. Next step should be an out of network access to the Pi and so to my data as a host.

This project is also a good point of start to lear stacking of multiple systems, data management, network connexion and so on.

Question to answer before starting code.
How to create a NAS ?
How to create a database mySQL
How to manage the database ? Which langage ?
How to automatize the savegard and format with RPI ?
